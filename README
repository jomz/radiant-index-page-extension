= About

This is for indexes that have no content for themselve.
For example, a site may be structured like so to keep things organised and clean;

/about
/about/history
/about/team
/about/objective

Now it is very possible that there is no content for the 'index' page on /about. With this extension you just make the page on /about an IndexPage, which will then redirect your visitors to it's first child.

TO-DO: Maybe i'll make it possible to config the page, so that you could also enter any other url to redirect to.
